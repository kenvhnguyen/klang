S: Single Responsibility
O: Open/Closed
L: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): subtypes must be substituable for supertype
I: ISP or Interface Segregation Principle: an interface should not force classes to implement function they don't need.
D: DRY or Don't Repeat Yourself

Encapsulation: members should all be private
Dependency Injection (DI) or Inversion of Control (IoC)
Composition over Inheritance: classical Java's fault of having Stack 'is-a' Vector instead of 'has-a'
Programming for Interface: so in the future, implementation can be changed
Delegation principles: delegate some tasks to the class such as comparison of objects of the class

Composition before Inheritance:
Inheritance is an "is-a" relationship. Composition is a "has-a".
You do composition by having an instance of another class C as a field of your class, instead of extending C.
A good example where composition would've been a lot better than inheritance is java.util.Stack, which currently extends java.util.Vector.
This is now considered a blunder. A stack "is-NOT-a" vector; you should not be allowed to insert and remove elements arbitrarily. It should've been composition instead.

Unfortunately it's too late to rectify this design mistake, since changing the inheritance hierarchy now would break compatibility with existing code.
Had Stack used composition instead of inheritance, it can always be modified to use another data structure without violating the API.

I highly recommend Josh Bloch's book Effective Java 2nd Edition

Item 16: Favor composition over inheritance
Item 17: Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it
Good object-oriented design is not about liberally extending existing classes. Your first instinct should be to compose instead.
